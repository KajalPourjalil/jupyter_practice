Safety has been a facade. Education for education’s sake hasn’t been as important as parents having somewhere to send their children.
"More time should be spent with education around proper mask use, ensuring cohorting is adhered to, and more transparent information should be available regarding positive cases within the school."
"I am a special education teacher with autistic students. We have been in the classroom throughout the year. We are alone in the school. There are no supports, no enhanced PPE, no enhanced cleaning routines or any check ins, support or communication from our consultants or superintendents. We are invisible to all…government, media, community and teaching colleagues and unions. We have worked as custodians, medical aides, family counsellors and mental health aides…and finally teachers. Absolutely no one is aware of our double, triple and quadruple duties. It is the most discriminated event I have ever experienced in my over 30 years of teaching. We are truly invisible. This is my final year of teaching…and what a year it has been."
It has been a very challenging year and I personally do NOT feel we have had the support of the Premier in any way. He has little understanding of the challenges teachers have faced. He doesn’t have a clue! I feel insulted and saddened by every remark he has made about teachers. His position is authoritarian and not inclusive in any way. I dont know of anyone in the school system who feels any support from him.
I support the decision to keep students in school but there is a lack of transparency in the number of cases and transmission rates at each school.
"Teachers should have access to the vaccine as we effect so many people. Mental health, making sure kids are happy and health have been bigger focuses than curricular outcomes."
